# Multi_Class_Image_Classification
Classify the Images into Multiple classes 

Simple yet effective method for build a powerful image classifier using Keras. It is done with flower dataset and few hundred or thousand pictures from 5 class are used. The model have been trained using Keras Library.The architecture of the neural network used here is commonly known as LeNet architecture.
 

To train the model : `python3 train_network.py --dataset training_set --model trained_model --plot plot`

To test the image : `python3 predict.py --dataset training_set --model trained_model --image test_set/daisy1.jpg`
